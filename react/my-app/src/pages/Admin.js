add function like in loan_bk.js to populate
the table with data from the database.
By clicking into one of the loans, the admin should be taken to a page dedicated to that loan
where they see the following:
o All data listed on the table above.
o The email address of the customer who owns the loan.
o The phone number of the customer who owns the loan.
o Bank and account details for automatic payments.
o The customerâ€™s scheduled automatic payments.
o A calculated pay-off date for the loan based on interest rate and scheduled payments.
